<h1>Intro</h1>


<p>The structure of this tutorial assumes an intermediate level
knowledge of Python but not much else. No knowledge of
concurrency is expected. The goal is to give you
the tools you need to get going with gevent and use it to solve
or speed up your applications today.</p>

<p>
The primary pattern provided by gevent is the <strong>Greenlet</strong>, a
lightweight coroutine provided to Python as a C extension module.
Greenlets all run inside of the OS process for the main
program but are scheduled cooperatively by libevent. This differs from
<a href="http://docs.python.org/library/subprocess.html">subprocceses</a> 
in which new processes are spawned by the OS.

<h2>Greenlets</h2>

<h3>Synchronous & Asynchronous Execution</h3>

The core idea of concurrency is that a larger task can be broken
down into a collection of subtasks whose operation does not
depend on the other tasks and thus can be sent side-by-side (
<strong>asynchronously</strong> ) inside of one at a time (
<strong>synchronously</strong> ). For example our 

<p>
A somewhat synthetic example defines a <code>task</code> function
which is <strong>non-deterministic</strong> 
(i.e. its output is not guaranteed to give the same result for
the same inputs). In this case the side effect of running the
function is that the task pauses its execution for a random
number of seconds.
</p>

<pre>
<code class="python">import gevent
import random

def task(pid):
    """
    Some non-deterministic task
    """
    gevent.sleep(random.randint(0,2))
    print 'Task', pid, 'done'

def synchronous():
    for i in range(1,10):
        task(i)

def asynchronous():
    threads = []
    for i in range(1,10):
        threads.append(gevent.spawn(task, i))
    gevent.joinall(threads)

print 'Synchronous:'
synchronous()

print 'Asynchronous:'
asynchronous()
</code>
</pre>

<p>
In the synchronous case all the tasks are run sequentially,
which results in the main programming <strong>blocking</strong> (
i.e. pausing the execution of the main program )
while each task executes.
</p>

The important parts of the program are the
<code>gevent.spawn</code> which wraps up the given function
inside of a Greenlet thread. The list of initialized greenlets 
are stored in the array <code>threads</code> which is passed to
the <code>gevent.joinall</code> function which blocks the current
program to run all the given greenlets. The execution will step
forward only when all the greenlets terminate.

<p>The output is:</p>

<pre>
<code>
Synchronous:
Task 1 done
Task 2 done
Task 3 done
Task 4 done
Task 5 done
Task 6 done
Task 7 done
Task 8 done
Task 9 done
Task 10 done
Asynchronous:
Task 2 done
Task 3 done
Task 5 done
Task 10 done
Task 8 done
Task 6 done
Task 9 done
Task 1 done
Task 4 done
Task 7 done
</code>
</pre>

<p>
The important fact to notice is that the order of execution in
the async case is essentially random and that the total execution
time in the async case is much less than the sync case. In fact
the maximum time for the synchronous case to complete is when
each tasks pauses for 2 seconds resulting in a 20 seconds for the
whole queue. In the async case the maximum runtime is roughly 2
seconds since none of the tasks block the execution of the
others.
</p>

<p>A more common use case, fetching data from a server
asynchronously, the runtime of <code>fetch()</code> will differ between
requests given the load on the remote server.</p>

<pre><code class="python">import gevent
import urllib2
import simplejson as json

def fetch(pid):
    response = urllib2.urlopen('http://json-time.appspot.com/time.json')
    result = response.read()
    json_result = json.loads(result)
    datetime = json_result['datetime']

    print 'Process ', pid, datetime
    return json_result['datetime']

def synchronous():
    for i in range(1,10):
        fetch(i)

def asynchronous():
    threads = []
    for i in range(1,10):
        threads.append(gevent.spawn(fetch, i))
    gevent.joinall(threads)

print 'Synchronous:'
synchronous()

print 'Asynchronous:'
asynchronous()
</code>
</pre>

<h3>Race Conditions</h3>

<p>The perennial problem involved with concurrency is known as a
<b>race condition</b>. Simply put is when two concurrent threads
/ processes depend on some shared resource but also attempt to
modify this value. This results in resources whose values become
time-dependent on the execution order. This is a problem, and in
general one should very much try to avoid race conditions since
they result program behavior which is globally non-deterministic.</p>

<p>One approach to avoiding race conditions is to simply not
have any global <b>state</b> shared between threads. To
communicate threads instead pass stateless messages between each 
other.</p>

<h3>Spawning threads</h3>

gevent provides a few wrappers around Greenlet initialization.
Some of the most common patterns are:

<pre>
<code class="python">import gevent
from gevent import Greenlet

def foo(message, n):
    """
    Each thread will be passed the message, and n arguments
    in its initialization.
    """
    print 'I live!'
    gevent.sleep(3)

# Initialize a new Greenlet instance running the named function
# foo
thread1 = Greenlet.spawn(foo, "Hello", 1)
thread1.start()

# Wrapper for creating and runing a new Greenlet from the named 
# function foo, with the passd arguments
thread2 = gevent.spawn(foo, "I live!", 2)

# Lambda expressions
thread3 = gevent.spawn(lambda x: (x+1), 2)

threads = [thread1, thread2, thread3]

# Block until all threads complete.
gevent.joinall(threads)

</code>
</pre>
</section>

<h3>Greenlet State</h3>

<p>Like any other segement of code Greenlets can fail in various
ways. A greenlet may fail throw an exception, fail to halt or
consume too many system resources.</p>

<p>The internal state of a greenlet is generally a time-depenent
parameter. There are a number of flags on greenlets which let
you monitor the state of the thread</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>started</code> -- Boolean, indicates whether the Greenlet has been started. </li>
    <li><code>ready()</code> -- Boolean, indicates whether the Greenlet has halted</li>
    <li><code>successful()</code> -- Boolean, indicates whether the Greenlet has halted and not thrown an exception</li>
    <li><code>value</code> -- arbitrary, the value returned by the Greenlet</li>
    <li><code>exception</code> -- exception, uncaught exception instance thrown inside the greenlet</li>
</ul>

<p>
Greenlets that fail to yield when the main program receives a
SIGQUIT may hold the program's execution longer than expected.
This results in so called "zombie processes" which need to be
killed from outside of the Python interpreter.
</p>

A common pattern is to listen SIGQUIT events on the main program
and to invoke <code>gevent.killall</code> before exit.

<pre>
<code class="python">import gevent

def run_forever():
    while True:
        pass

def main():
    thread = gevent.spawn(run_forever)
    gevent.joinall([thread])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        main()
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        gevent.killall()
</code>
</pre>

<h3>Holding Side Effects</h3>

In this example we hold the side effects of executing an
arbitrary string, 

<pre>
<code class="python">from gevent import Greenlet

def run_code(code, env={}):
    local = locals()
    local.update(env)
    exec(code, globals(), local)
    return local

env = {}

while True:
    code = raw_input('>')

    g = Greenlet.spawn(run_code, code, env)
    g.join() # block until code executes

    # If succesfull then pass the locals to the next command
    if g.value:
        env = g.get()
    else:
        print g.exception
</code>
